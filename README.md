# Hi, I'm Nacho 👋

I'm currently focused on Java as part of my software development studies, but I also use Flutter + Dart whenever I want to build small desktop tools that make my workflow faster.

I use Linux (Fedora + Hyprland) 🐧, and many of my projects come from trying to improve small parts of my setup.

[subfix](https://github.com/ifgar/subfix) is a good example: I got tired of running a CLI script every time I needed to sync subtitles, so I built a lightweight GUI to make the process instant. I want to keep creating tools like that, maybe even something for Waybar in the future.
